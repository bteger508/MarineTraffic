Final project for CS 418

To set up the project, add the src and test folders to your work directory. 

Then, navigate to your work directory and run this command:

npm install mocha chai --save-dev


Insert this code into the package.json file:

"scripts": {
    "test": "mocha"
 },
 
 
 (This will allow us to run npm test from our work directory)
 
 
 Make sure your work directory contains the following structure:
 
|test
|src
|node_modules
package.json
